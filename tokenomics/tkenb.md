## Why TKENB Has A Hard Cap?

There's a hard cap on the supply of TKENB, with a burn mechanism making it a deflationary coin. 

{% hint style="info" %}
TKENB primary function is to become a deflationary utility coin with decreased supply and increased value over time, to incentivize people to mine it, hold it, and use it.
{% endhint %}

## What is TKENB Deflationary Mechanism?

**Transfer tax**

As mentioned previously, there is a 12%-14% transfer tax on each transaction, the 10% transfer tax will be sold to get BNB through the contract automatically. Every time the total of this transfer tax exceed 50,000 TKENB the contract will automatically sell 50,000 TKENB for BNB and adding to TKENB's contract. This number \(50,000\) can be changed depend on the price of TKENB.

This liquidity will be locked in TKENB contract, no one, not even the developers can withdraw it, and this liquidity will be used for automatic buy backs and burn. It is very beneficial for long term because it keep price level of TKENB and raises it over time.

**Other burning mechanisms**

* Developing games for burning mechanisms. Regular token burns are built into many of TKENB's products \(like a high burn rate of up to 100% of TKENB spent on lottery tickets\), with more on the way
* New ideas and developments such as Predictions betting in progress
