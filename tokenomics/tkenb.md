## Why TKENB Has No Hard Cap? <a id="why-panther-has-no-hard-cap"></a>

Currently there is no hard cap on the supply of TKENB, making it an inflationary token.

Community members often point to this as a cause for concern, and while the DEV team certainly understands the wish for a hard cap, we don't expect to set one in the near future.

TKENB's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity for the exchange.  
Without block rewards, there would be much less incentive to provide liquidity.
