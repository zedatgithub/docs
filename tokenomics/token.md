## Transfer Tax <a id="transfer-tax"></a>

{% endhint %}

## Emission Rate <a id="emission-rate"></a>

Initial emission rate is set to **1 DEFI / block** and this value will be **increased** as the TVL grows, in order to keep the APR high.

## Why DEFI Has No Hard Cap? <a id="why-panther-has-no-hard-cap"></a>

Currently there is no hard cap on the supply of DEFI, making it an inflationary token.

Community members often point to this as a cause for concern, and while the DEV team certainly understands the wish for a hard cap, we don't expect to set one in the near future.

DEFI's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity for the exchange.  
Without block rewards, there would be much less incentive to provide liquidity.
