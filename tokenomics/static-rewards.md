## Why Static Rewards?

Static rewards solve a host of problems. First, the reward amount depends on the volume of the token being traded. This mechanism aims to alleviate some of the downwards selling pressure put on the token caused by earlier adopters selling their tokens after farming crazy high APYs. Second, the _reflection mechanism_ encourages holders to keep holding their tokens to garner higher kick-backs day by day because their holding percentage is increased each time someone buys or sells.

### **Automatic Rewards to Holders**

When TKENB is transferred, a **14%** tax fee is taxed for each transaction: **10%** is used for [automatic buy backs and burn](../features/automatic-burning.md), while the remaining **4%** is redistributed among existing TKENB holders as [static rewards](static-rewards.md). 

Those who decide to hold their TKENB are rewarded from those who sell, so this mechanism encourages holders and discourages pump and dump traders. Holders are incentivized to hold their coin because their holdings will increase over time. And even if TKENB investors take no action, they still collect additional TKENB just by holding it.
