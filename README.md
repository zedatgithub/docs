### About DEFI <a id="about-pantherswap"></a>

DEFI is the one **stable-pairs-only** yield farm and AMM decentralized exchange running on Binance Smart Chain, featuring the first ever **Boosted Farms** innovation, together with lots of other unique and creative features.

## **Main Features** <a id="main-features"></a>

* [Boosted Farms](features/harvest-lockup.md) where all the farms' multipliers are cycled through a boosted/normal state at exact hours of a day \(so, at the same time for every one\), multiple times a day; harvest lockup time is tied to these cycles and harvesting becomes possible at multiplier state change
* [Farming Pools](features/token-pools.md) where you deposit DEFI and earn **other tokens**
* [Locked Liquidity](features/locked-liquidity.md) 
* Farms allows you to [compound](features/farms-pools-compound.md) your LP tokens and, whenever you use this feature on a farm _\*\*_
  * **without a deposit** **fee**, the **token tax** will be 50% of the regular token tax
  * **with a deposit** **fee**, the fee for re-staking you LP tokens will be **50%** of the regular fee you'd have to pay if you were to deposit the LPs yourself
  * harvest lookup time is also reduced with **50%** 
* Pools allow you to [compound](features/farms-pools-compound.md) your tokens without any token tax

* [AMM](features/amm.md) available from the very beginning, using an industry low fee of **0.2%** per transaction
* improved [Referral Program](features/referral-program.md) where you now know who your referrer is and **you** are the one deciding if you want to have a referrer at all, who your referrer is and when to confirm your referrer
* [Anti Bot](features/anti-bot.md) mechanism preventing Bots from buying/selling the token too frequently
* [Anti Whale](features/anti-whale.md) mechanism preventing Whales from quickly buying/selling large amounts \(pump & dump\)
