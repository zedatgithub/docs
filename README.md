## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

DXAMMFinance.One is the Galactic yield farm and multi-chain bridge, running on [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain), [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/), [Huobi Eco \(HECO\)](https://www.hecochain.com/en-us/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) and [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/), with yield farming, staking, lottery, auto-compounding vaults and more.

Our **MasterChef contract** is an **exact 1:1 fork** of thoreum.finance's MasterChef contract; [here are the 2 contracts compared](https://bscscan.com/contractdiffchecker?a1=0xf4168cd3c00799beeb9a88a6bf725eb84f5d41b7&a2=0xAf5Ff8E51648847c0e94eDC855ddD364E72a66EF) \(you have to click on the "Compare Difference" button at the bottom\) - you will notice that the only difference is that we changed all instances of **THOREUM** to **TKENB**.
