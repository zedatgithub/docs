# ðŸ”¥ Emergency Withdraw

If something is to happen to our front-end such as a DDOS attack or a temporary outage, farmers can still withdraw their tokens by directly interacting with the [MasterChef](https://bscscan.com/address/0x73feaa1ee314f8c655e354234017be2193c9e24e#writeContract) contract.

Call the _**emergencyWithdraw**_ function using the `farm id` listed below to withdraw your staked tokens.
