# 🛡️ Emergency Withdraw

If something is to happen to our front-end such as a DDOS attack or a temporary outage, farmers can still withdraw their tokens by directly interacting with the MasterChef [contract](../tokenomics/contracts.md).

Call the _**emergencyWithdraw**_ function using the `farm id` listed below to withdraw your staked tokens.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Withdraw without caring about pending rewards and last Harvest Lockup compounds. EMERGENCY ONLY.
{% endhint %}

Farming ID can be found in the [Yield Farms](../features/harvest-lockup.md) page
