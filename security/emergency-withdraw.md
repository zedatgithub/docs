# 🛡️ Emergency Withdraw

If something is to happen to our front-end - such as a DDOS attack or a temporary outage, farmers can still withdraw their funds by directly interacting with the [MasterChef contract](../tokenomics/contracts.md).

Call the _**emergencyWithdraw**_ function using the `farm id` listed [here](../features/harvest-lockup.md) to withdraw your staked tokens.

Withdraw without caring about pending rewards and last Harvest Lockup compounds. EMERGENCY ONLY.
