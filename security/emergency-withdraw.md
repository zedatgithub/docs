# 🛡️ Emergency Withdraw

If something is to happen to our front-end such as a DDOS attack or a temporary outage, farmers can still withdraw their tokens by directly interacting with the [MasterChef](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x4d751991267545db23f5b8f7bad4cc975b1f5351#writeContract) contract.

Call the _**emergencyWithdraw**_ function using the `farm id` listed below to withdraw your staked tokens.
