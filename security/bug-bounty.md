# 🐛 Bug Bounty

All contracts will be deployed with liquidity on Mainnet at [\#6920000](https://testnet.bscscan.com/block/countdown/6922000) so that community/auditors will have enough time to review the live smart contracts and in case **High Severity Issues** are found, these will be fixed, the new smart contracts will be redeployed and [Bug Bounty](bug-bounty.md) rewards will be given.

Bug Bounty will be paid 2 weeks after farming starts or, if a bug is found afterwards, after the reporting date from [Fee/Tax Distribution](../features/deposit-fee-redistribution.md)
