## **Why Presale?**  <a id="why-presale"></a>

Nowadays, all fair-launches on BSC are destroyed by bots; presale is actually fairer for people to participate equally and without the price being altered by bots.

We want more people to own TKENB than a few whales with big bags as that it is healthier for the growth of the ecosystem,

The presale rates are as follow:

On **Binance Smart Chain**:

| **Asset** | = | Rate |
| ---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 **BNB** | = | 35,000 TKENB |
| 0.001 **BTC** | = | 35,000 TKENB |
| 0.01 **ETH** | = | 35,000 TKENB |
| 100 **BUSD** | = | 35,000 TKENB |
| 100 **USDT** | = | 35,000 TKENB |
| 100 **USDC** | = | 35,000 TKENB |
| 100 **DAI** | = | 35,000 TKENB |

The reason behind this price is that we want all early holders of TKENB to have very good returns, so we set a price that can benefit everyone that trusted TKENB from the start.
