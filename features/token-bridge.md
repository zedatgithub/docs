# üîÅ Bridge & Exchange

You can use the Bridge to transfer assets between Binance Smart Chain, Heco, Polygon and Fantom networks. Thanks to the bridge you will be able to look for arbitrage opportunities in any of the deployed chains for either the NATIVE tokens or the farming APRs.

When transferring NATIVE tokens, the regular Transfer Tax \(see [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md)\) will be discounted from 8% to **0%** instead.

Transferring other than NATIVE tokens will incur a **0.2%** trading fee.

Optional user can opt to Anonimize transaction.  
  
Transaction privacy is ensured by separating the on-chain link between recipient and destination addresses, and the involved amount.It utilizes a smart contract that obfuscates the receiving address on the chain and then, **within the next hour**, it sends the requested amount to the receiving address via 2 separate transactions with the original amount split randomly between the two.  
Using this feature incurs a **1%** fee and sent to [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md)

In order to provide liquidity for this feature, **9.09%** of the emission rate is directed to the bridge contract.

[Anti Whale](anti-whale.md) measures still apply.
