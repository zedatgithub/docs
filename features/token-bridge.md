# üîÅ Bridge & Exchange

You can use the Bridge to transfer assets between [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain), [Huobi Eco \(HECO\)](https://www.hecochain.com/en-us/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) and [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/) networks. Thanks to the bridge you can easily transfer your assets from one network to another and you may also look for arbitrage opportunities for either TKENB or the farming APRs.

When transferring TKENB, the regular Transfer Tax \(see [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md)\) will be discounted from **4%** to **0%** instead.

Using the bridge incurs a **1%** fee.

Optionally, users can opt to **anonymize** their transactions.  
  
Transaction privacy for anonymized transactions is ensured by separating the on-chain link between recipient and destination addresses, and the involved amount. It utilizes a smart contract that obfuscates the receiving address on the chain and then, **within the next hour**, it sends the requested amount to the receiving address via 2 separate transactions with the original amount split randomly between the two.

Using the anonymize feature incurs an additional **1%** fee which is sent to [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md).

You can use the Bridge to send a network's native token \(BNB/HT/MATIC/FTM\*\) to a fresh/blank wallet so you don't have to worry about having any to pay for fees.

In order to provide liquidity for this feature, **9.09%** of the emission rate is directed to the bridge contract.

[Anti Whale](anti-whale.md) measures still apply.
