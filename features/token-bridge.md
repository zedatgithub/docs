# üîÅ Token Bridge

You can use the Bridge to transfer assets between Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Fantom networks. Thanks to the bridge you will be able to look for arbitrage opportunities in any of the deployed chains for either the NATIVE tokens or the farming APRs.

When transferring TKENA and TKENB the regular Transfer Tax of 8% \(see [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md)\) does not apply and will be **0%** instead.

In order to provide liquidity for this feature, **9.09%** of the emission rate is directed to the bridge contract.  
  
[Anti Bot](anti-bot.md) and [Anti Whale](anti-whale.md) measures still apply.
