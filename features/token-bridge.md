# üîÅ Token Bridge

You can use the Bridge to transfer assets between Binance Smart Chain, Heco, Polygon and Fantom networks. Thanks to the bridge you will be able to look for arbitrage opportunities in any of the deployed chains for either the NATIVE tokens or the farming APRs.

When transferring NATIVE tokens, the regular Transfer Tax  \(see [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md)\) will be discounted from 8% to **0%** instead.

Transferring other than NATIVE tokens will incur a **0.2%** trading fee.

In order to provide liquidity for this feature, **9.09%** of the emission rate is directed to the bridge contract.

[Anti Whale](anti-whale.md) measures still apply.
