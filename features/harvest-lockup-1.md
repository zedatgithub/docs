# ‚è≥ Harvest Lockup

**Harvest lockup** mechanism is implemented where harvesting is possible only once the **harvest** **lockup timer** expires. The remaining time until harvesting becomes possible is shown on each farm/pool card.

This feature can help us limit the harvesting frequency and prevent farming arbitrage bots from constantly harvesting and dumping.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **harvest lockup** only locks users' _farming rewards -_ staked LP tokens in farms can be withdrawn at anytime.
{% endhint %}

You can check the harvest lockup on each farm/pool card.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Unstaking before **harvest lockup** expiration time will result in the loss of the pending rewards and of the compounded amount, both of which will be instead sent to [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md)
{% endhint %}
