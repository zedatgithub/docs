# ‚è≥ Harvest Lockup

**Harvest lockup** mechanism is also implemented where harvesting is possible only once the **lockup time** expires. The remaining time until harvesting becomes possible is shown on each farm's card.

This feature can help us limit the harvesting frequency and prevent farming arbitrage bots from constantly harvesting and dumping.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **harvest lockup** only locks users' _farming rewards -_ staked LP tokens in farms can be withdrawn at anytime.
{% endhint %}

You can check the harvest lockup on each farm/pool/vault card.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Unstaking before **harvest lockup** expiration time _\*\*_will result in the loss of the pending rewards and of the compounded amount, both of which will be instead sent to [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md)
{% endhint %}
