# ðŸ’° Fee/Tax Distribution

## Hourly Fee/Tax Distribution <a id="deposit-fee"></a>

* 30% of collected TKENB will be injected into the [Lottery](lottery.md)
* 50% of collected TKENB will be [ðŸ”¥BURNEDðŸ”¥](https://testnet.bscscan.com/token/0x8a5a76401ada8998603d982d8343752fec75972b?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD)
* 60% of the BUSD\*/BNB/BTCB/ETH will be converted to BUSD\* and will be held in the fee address as buyback reserve. From the fee address, every hour, `BUSD* value in buyback reserve/30/24` will be used for TKENB buybacks and added as [locked](locked-liquidity.md) TKENB-BUSD\* [liquidity](automatic-liquidity.md). The formula above ensures that the buyback reserve is not used up instantly but the BUSD\* amount in the buyback reserve is evenly split for hourly buybacks \(`24` hours/day\) over one month period \(`30` days\). The formula is applied every hour to the existing value in the buyback reserve
* 20% of the BUSD/BNB/BTCB/ETH will be sent to developer address for future development
