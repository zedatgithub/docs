# ðŸŒ¾ Farming Pools

Farming pools allow DEFI holders to stake their DEFI and earn DEFI, BUSD, USDT, USDC, DAI tokens.

Most projects claim to implement this feature 14-21 days after launch but we decided to have it from the very beginning.

There will be a **harvest lockup**, specific for each pool, meaning that the pending earnings **can not be withdrawn** as long as the lockup is in effect.

You can add more DEFI tokens / [compound](farms-pools-compound.md) to any pool, at any time, in order to increase your earning rewards.

Every time you **harvest** your earnings will be sent to your wallet and a new **harvest lockup** timer is set for the next reward cycle. The harvest lockup is specific to each pool and is shown on each pool's card.
