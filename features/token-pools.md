# ðŸŒ¾ Pools

There will be a **harvest lockup**, specific for each pool, meaning that the pending earnings **can not be withdrawn** as long as the lockup is in effect.

Every time you **harvest** your earnings will be sent to your wallet and a new **harvest lockup** timer is set for the next reward cycle. The harvest lockup is specific to each pool and is shown on each pool's card.
