# ðŸ¤– Anti Bot

A new Anti-Bot protection system is premiered by DXAMM Finance in order to prevent bots from buying/selling the NATIVE Token too frequently.

A minimum of **15 seconds** must pass between **every** NATIVE token transfer.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When transferring NATIVE token from one wallet to another, the condition must be true for both wallets.
{% endhint %}
