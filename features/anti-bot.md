# ðŸ¤– Anti Bot

A new Anti-Bot protection system is premiered by DEFI in order to prevent bots from buying/selling the token too frequently.

A minimum of **5 blocks** \(_approximately 15 seconds_\) must pass between **every** DEFI transfer. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
When transferring DEFI from one wallet to another,  the condition must be true for both wallets.
{% endhint %}

> The current value can be viewed in the [DEFI](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x291999fd2120e4bddb3cf834180a15552677d6fd#readContract) token contract.
