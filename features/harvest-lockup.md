# ‚è∞ Boosted Farms

**Boosted Farms** is a unique and creative way of farming where each farm's multiplier is constantly being cycled between a **boosted** \(very-high APR\) and a **cool-down** mode \(lower APR\).

The farm's multiplier changes at exact hours \(shown on each farm's card\), affecting everyone in the same way.

## Example

For example, the DEFI-BUSD farm has a multiplier changing cycle of **2 hours** and its multiplier cycles between **40x** and **4x** \(just these 2 values\). This means that, at the start, the farm will run with a multiplier of **40x** for **2 hours**. After the 2 hours have passed, harvesting becomes possible and the farm's multiplier changes from **40x** to **4x**, and the cycle will repeat.
