# üíµ Vaults Auto Compound

## What is a Vault? <a id="what-is-a-vault"></a>

Vaults are investment instruments making use of automation to continually reinvest deposited funds, which help to achieve high levels of compounded interest. You earn more of the asset you stake in it regardless if this is an liquidity pool \(LP\) token or a single asset. For example, vaults where one can stake USDC-USDT LP will result in more USDC-USDT LP over time, effectively growing your share in the vault and thus allowing for more and more rewards over time.

When browsing the vaults on the platform, you will see the annual percentage yield \(APY\), which takes the frequent compounding into consideration compared to annual percentage rate \(APR\) which does not.

Summarizing, vaults can:

* Compound rewards into the initially deposited asset
* Use any asset as liquidity
* Put any asset to work to generate a yield
* Reinvest earned profits
* Stake your NATIVE Tokens or LP Tokens and forget about it - the NATIVE or LP Tokens you stake in this Vaults will be automatically compounded \(reinvested\) for you for a small fee
* The ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded \(see below\)
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 48 hours of manually staking \(see below\)

## What are the fees for the Vaults? <a id="what-are-the-fees-for-the-auto-cake-syrup-pool"></a>

**Deposit fee**

* 0% fee for NATIVE token/pairs 
* 4%‚Ä®   fee for NON NATIVE pairs

**Unstaking fee**

* **4%‚Ä®   if you unstake \(withdraw\) within 48 hours.**
* Only applies within 2 days of manually staking.
* After 2 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 2-day timer resets every time you manually stake more in the vault.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking - it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* Example: if the harvest was 1 TKENA, then 0.02 TKENA would be subtracted as the performance fee.

Fees collected from early unstaking as well as the performance fees are sent to [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md)

## What‚Äôs the Bounty? <a id="whats-the-auto-cake-bounty"></a>

**Bounty: 0.5% of the respective pool pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you‚Äôre also helping out by activating the Auto CAKE Pool‚Äôs compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of NATIVE Token you receive will be greater than the BNB/MATIC fees you‚Äôll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!

## Why can't someone just do this themselves? <a id="why-cant-someone-just-do-this-themselves"></a>

They could, but vaults help you save on personal time and transaction fees, ,and automatically reinvest earnings. Attempting to do this manually would result in large inefficiencies. Basically, "Sit back and relax, the vault does all the work for you."

## **Does the performance fee get taken out when I withdraw my funds?** <a id="does-the-performance-fee-get-taken-out-when-i-withdraw-my-funds"></a>

* No, the perfomance fee are taken every time someone claims Bounty. Because it will trigger the harvesting and the compound for everyone.

## Does the vault page show the APY? <a id="does-the-vault-page-show-the-apy"></a>

Yes. Our displayed APY values reflect the predicted rate earned on a vault in a year. This rate is determined the total amount of funds in the vault and takes into account the effect of compounding. As a unique feature, we have also included all vault fees in the APY calculation. What you see is what you get!

## What risks do the vaults have? <a id="what-risks-do-the-vaults-have"></a>

Below are some of the general vault risks:

* Assets deposited into the vault have no risk of decreasing in quantity but can decrease in monetary value.
* Vaults assests are hold in the MasterContract.

## **How do LP vaults work?** <a id="how-do-lp-vaults-work"></a>

Liquidity pool \(LP\) vaults work by reinvesting the fees awarded to LP participants. In return for providing liquidity to the pool, many platforms reward investors with tokens. Our vaults regularly harvest these rewards, sell it, buy more of the LP‚Äôs underlying assets, and then reinvest to complete the cycle.

This compounds the rewards gained from a liquidity pool. 

## **How often are balances updated in the vaults?** <a id="how-often-are-balances-updated-in-the-vaults"></a>

* Everytime if somebody collects the Bounty or the Automated compound which runs 6 time per day.
