# üèß Automatic Liquidity

We use the Automatic Liquidity feature differently, as explained in [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md) section. Basically, for creating BUSD-PANCAKE LPs we use whatever **BUSD** we collect from the **deposit fee** charged for staking on NON PANCAKE farms, while the **PANCAKE** will come from the **transfer tax**. Therefore, we will not sell PANCAKE at any point.

So, how is the _Automatic Liquidity_ working for other projects and why it is bad \(as most projects have suffered instead of gaining because of this feature\):

Every time a transaction takes place, half of the amount from the transfer is kept as token while the other half is **sold** for BUSD in order to create LP tokens for the PANCAKE-BUSD farm.

Therefore, when somebody **BUYS** token, the contract automatically **SELLS** half of the tax fee for BUSD making the price _go down_. And when somebody **SELLS** token, the contract automatically **SELLS** half of the tax fee for BUSD making the price _go down_. 

This feature creates constant _selling pressure_ so we decided against it.

Have a look at [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md) for more on how the fees are used.
