# ðŸ’± AMM

Our AMM exchange is a complete fork of PancakeSwap v1.

We consider that **0.2% trading fee** is high enough and so we will not use Pancake v2 **0.25% trading fee.**

On PancakeSwap v1 the **0.2% trading fee** was split between **0.17%** going to liquidity providers while **0.03%** going into the treasury. The **0.17%** going to liquidity providers was not really an earning until the liquidity providers did not unstake and remove the liquidity so, overall, it was not a predictable source of income nor could this be reinvested \(compounded\).

Instead we decided to use all of the **0.2% trading fee** which is sent to [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md) and use it to give more value to the NATIVE tokens so that the liquidity providers can earn more a valuable token which they can reinvest \([compound](farms-pools-compound.md) or [vault](vaults-auto-compound.md)\).

[Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain), [Huobi Eco \(HECO\)](https://www.hecochain.com/en-us/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) and [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/) contracts can be found in the [Contracts](../tokenomics/contracts.md) section.

The Factory & Router smart contracts are the same as PancakeSwap's. The only things we changed in these two contracts are:

* "pancake" to "DXAMM"
* treasury fee from **0.03%** to **0.20%**, sent to [Fee/Tax Distribution](deposit-fee-redistribution.md) in Factory \(the **0.17%** fee sent to liquidity providers will automatically become **0** because of the way the contract is coded\)

```javascript
uint denominator = rootK.mul(3).add(rootKLast);

to

uint denominator = rootK.mul(20).add(rootKLast);
```

It means that the contracts where the liquidity is stored \(your money\) are as safe as PancakeSwap's.
