# ⚡ Launch

New kind of Fair Launch

* No Pre-sale
* No Pre-mine\*
* All contracts will be deployed with liquidity on Mainnet at [\#6920000](https://testnet.bscscan.com/block/countdown/6922000) so that community/auditors will have enough time to review the live smart contracts and in case **High Severity Issues** are found, these will be fixed, the new smart contracts will be redeployed and [Bug Bounty](security/bug-bounty.md) rewards will be given. You may ask why so much delays - we are here to stay and we intend to start a long-run project, we are not in hurry and we wish to build a safe and fair project.
* Token trading will start at block [\#6922000](https://testnet.bscscan.com/block/countdown/6922000) - 1 week after contracts deployed and review/audit
* Farming will start at block [\#6924000](https://testnet.bscscan.com/block/countdown/6922000) - 2 week later so that every one had fair chance to get tokens
* Pools will start at block [\#6928000](https://testnet.bscscan.com/block/countdown/6922000) - 2 days later so that we can fill the BUSD pool
* Emission Rate: 1 DEFI/block but will be increased as the TVL grows to keep APR high

{% hint style="info" %}
\*The developer will mine 20,000 DEFI for liquidity pools which will be distributed as follows:

* **DEFI-BUSD**: 5,000 DEFI - 1,000 BUSD
* **DEFI-USDT**: 5,000 DEFI - 1,000 BUSD
* **DEFI-USDC**: 5,000 DEFI - 1,000 BUSD
* **DEFI-DAI**:     5,000 DEFI - 1,000 BUSD
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
LP tokens can be deposited into the farms before farming starts but there will be **no farming rewards** until farming has started. Harvest lookup time countdown will also start when the farming start.   
  
Many projects give superior advantage to early depositors because they will be able to harvest earlier than those how deposited when the farming started. We want to give equal chance to everyone.
