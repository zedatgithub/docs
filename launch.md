# ðŸš€ Launch

New kind of Fair Launch

* No Pre-sale
* No Pre-mine\*
* Locked Liquidity
* All contracts will be deployed with liquidity simultaneously on all chains - Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\), Heco, Polygon and Fantom start block can be viewed in [countdown](countdown.md) section\(BSC\) so that community/auditors will have enough time to review the smart contracts and, in case any **High Severity Issues** are to be found, these will be fixed, the new smart contracts will be deployed, and [Bug Bounty](security/bug-bounty.md) rewards will be given.
* TKENA trading [countdown](countdown.md) - 1 week after initial contracts deployment
* Farming [countdown](countdown.md) - 2 weeks after initial contracts deployment
* [IFO](features/tkenb-ifo.md) for TKENB [countdown](countdown.md) - 3 weeks after initial contracts deployment
* Emission Rates:

{% hint style="warning" %}
LP tokens can be deposited into the farms before farming starts but there will be **no farming rewards** until farming starts. Harvest lookup time countdown will also start when the farming starts.

Many projects give superior advantage to early depositors because they will be able to harvest earlier than those how deposited when the farming started. We want to give equal chance to everyone.
